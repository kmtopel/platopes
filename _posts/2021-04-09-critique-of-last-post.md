title: Critique of "Consciousness as a Data Structure"
thesis: I need to separate the wheat from the chaff regarding my post "Consciousness as a Data Structure".
---
In the spirit of intellectual honesty and humility, I need to acknowledge my dissatisfaction with my <a href="http://www.platopes.com/philosophy%20of%20mind/neuroscience/2021/01/18/consciousness-as-global-workspace.html">last post</a>. It's one of my first attempts at writing a long-form elucidation of my ideas regarding consciousness, so some sloppiness is to be expected.

First, let me state what I liked about my post:
1. The idea that consciousness is a phenomenon that necessarily includes brain and world.
2. The argument that solipsism isn't disproved by rational argument, but by a pre-cognitive awareness. We <i>feel</i> that other people are conscious and our experience accords with and confirms this assumption. We can't prove it directly without <i>being</i> that other person â€“ i.e. seeing things from their first-person perspective directly.
3. The thought experiment to explain point 2 above is well-conceived (in my opinion).

What I need to develop more:
1. The idea of a "data structure" as it applies to consciousness/mind. I didn't develop this idea sufficiently or define my terms adequately. Yes, the mind has it's way of organizing incoming sense data and compressing it into a usable, actionable form, but I need to consult more research before I can say anything about this phenomenon.
2. The idea that consciousness is "intentional," meaning it is always <i>about</i> something, needs to reckon with the fact that objects that appear to be part of the objective external world could be artifacts of internal mental models. Even in cases where hallucinations/delusions aren't taking place, the objective referents of internal mental models could be very different from each other, and my invocation of intentionality to explain consciousness needs to clearly define what "external environment" means in this context.
3. This post should've been split up into multiple posts, since there's a plethora of different topics I (unsuccessfully) try to treat all in the course of one post.

I am resisting the temptation to redact or remove any older posts that I dislike or disagree with, so these critiques are going to be how I handle them instead. Look for additional critiques to come!
